This project is now complete. It fulfills Lab 2 for Rice University Mechanical Engineering course MECH 498. 
No work will now be done on this code. 

To run this code for fun to see what we made, download the zip, extract the matlab files, and run 
drawFanuc3D('lolilolipop.mat')
This will draw a 6 DOF robot as it traces the path file we created and named lolipop, since it looks like a lolipop.

I won't apologize for my vulgarity. Bitches.
